# javascript-tutorials

In this repository I store files that I use in my process of studying JavaScript.

The two main sources that I study from are: [The Coding Train's Programming with Text series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YrbSJBg32eTzUU50E2B8Ch) (also known as: Programming from A to Z) and [Martijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
